# CustomLibraries

This is where I'll try to keep all the libraries I use current--I'll update at the end of every day if you wanna peek at anything

#####I have written READMEs for the five main libraries I have written for this project. They can be found within their respective folders.

(The five are mocks, OLEDResponses, TicketflyBLE, SDBeacon and Testing)

See note below for information on Mod/Clone libraries.

-----------------------------------------------------

### NOTE: I wouldn't suggest reading through the Mod/Clone libraries as they are near carbon copies with additional class calls made in their respective .h/.cpp files. 
Apart from that (and especially in the services and utility files/folders) I have made NO CHANGES so it is a waste of time to read through and try to understand unless you're really that morbidly curious. There should be sufficient documentation on the individual methods within these, and no interior methods are used within any of my examples--just the ones from the wrapper/mock classes are implemented.
