# CustomLibraries

This is where I'll try to keep all the libraries I use current--I'll update at the end of every day if you wanna peek at anything

### NOTE: I wouldn't suggest reading through the Mod/Clone libraries as they are near carbon copies with additional class calls made in their respective .h files. Apart from that (and especially in the services/utility files/folders) I have made NO CHANGES so it is a waste of time to read through and try to understand unless you're really that morbidly curious.
