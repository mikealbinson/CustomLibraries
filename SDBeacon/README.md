#SDBeacon
This library is based on the SdFat Library and is inteded for use with the arduino SD shield or similar. It provides a further wrapper class for SdFat and attempts to make it a little easier to read and write to the SD card.

You will need to include:
1. SdFatMod (from my custom libraries)
2. SPI.h (included in arduino libs, so no need to download, just include it in your .ino sketch)

######PLEASE NOTE that to use the SD card you will need to declare a SdFat object
How to do so is shown below in the function description section

| TicketInfoParser();        | Parses an entered line to pull out the specified information. Returns different info based on what you task it to find.                                                                            | String TicketString:The whole line you want parsed, commas included.  int receiveType: the kind of information you want to parse from the TicketString string: 1=TKTNumber 2=TKTName 3=TKT_Type                                                                                                                                                                      | Returns a String of the information you indicated in typeReturn for the line entered.                                               | Designed to read an SD card line with the format: TicketNumber, TicketName, TicketType could read other styles of information but they must be stored in a similar format.                                         |
| parseTextLines();          | Combines the above two functions to read from a SD file, parse the file on each line for the ticket information and compare it to the input ticket to see if the input exists within the database. | String ticketReceived:the ticket number/name you want to search the database for.  int receiveType: the kind of information you want to search the database for (must match the type of information you entered): 1=TKTNumber 2=TKTName 3=TKT_TypeSdFat& SD:The SdFat object you initialized.  TicketflySDBeacon& SDB: The SDBeacon you call the function with. See  | Returns the information from the matching ticket in the database if the ticket exists. Returns nothing if the ticket doesn't exist. | A much more complex search, but takes up more space at compilation time.  It's annoying you need to enter the SDBeacon you use to call this method as an argument to the method. This is something I'm working on. |
